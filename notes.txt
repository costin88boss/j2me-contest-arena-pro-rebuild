Controls:
Q and W for left and right softkeys.
Arrow keys for nav, unless phone is set to "Standard", when arrow keys become 2, 4, 6, and 8.
Numbers work as expected, the number pad is inverted (123 swap with 789, like a phone)
E and R are alternatives to * and #.
Enter functions as the Fire key or 5 on "Standard" mode
ESC brings up the settings menu
In the AWT frontend (freej2me.jar) Ctrl+C takes a screenshot and +/- can be used to control the window scaling factor
